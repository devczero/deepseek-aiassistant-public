THIS PROMPT IS FOR UI ENHANCEMENTS
Design a modern, minimalistic user interface inspired by ShadCN UI but with an elevated, luxurious feel. The interface should feature:

A dark background for a sleek and futuristic look, with vibrant accent colors to highlight interactive elements.
Clean lines and ample white space to maintain clarity and focus.
Intuitive navigation that feels effortless and professional, like something designed by an expensive, high-end UI designer.
Use subtle shadows, smooth transitions, and rounded corners (2xl or larger) for a polished finish.
Incorporate modern typography with bold headings and legible text, balancing elegance and readability.
Ensure the design feels cohesive, consistent, and visually striking while staying user-friendly



PROMPT 1

Please generate a full landing page in Next.js that will mainly display a 
chat window for interacting with you (DeepSeek R1). The chat window 
is rendered through the <YourComponent /> component, which is already implemented.
 Assume the chat window handles user input and AI responses.

The page design should have:

A modern, futuristic, beautiful, and minimalistic look.
Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
A dark theme by default, with gradients or subtle glowing effects.
A centered chat window as the main focus.
A header with the title: 'DeepSeek AI Chat', styled with futuristic typography.
A brief description below the header, explaining how to use the chat window.
Ensure the design is fully responsive and clean.
Provide the full Next.js page code, ready to paste into app/page.tsx."



PROMPT 2

Please, on page, add these features:

-switch from reasoner to chat model and back: there will be a switch, that will allow user to switch to chat model and back to reasoner model
-templating: somewhere on the page, will be a button that will say "generate a clerk auth for web application", that will set the prompt to our chatbot
and he will answer to prompt for generating a clerk auth for web application, making user not needed to take any action, just click that button and chat
will start answering


PROMPT 3

I want to enhance the functionality of my project by adding new features. Here's what I need:

1. Model Selection
Placement: The model selection should be displayed above the chat window.
Purpose: Users can easily switch models before interacting with the chat.
2. Template Features
Placement: The template features should be placed on the left-hand side of the interface.
add a functionality: when the template features are clicked (any of them), i dont want user to hit send, but i want this to be sent automatically
to deepseek, so he starts to respond immediately
Additional Templates to Add:
Stripe Integration: A pre-made template for implementing Stripe payment processing.
Prisma ORM Models: Templates for a User and Subscription schema with prompts for setting up models and testing database calls.
Environment Variable Templates: Auto-generate .env file templates for Supabase, Stripe, and Clerk configurations.
3. New Feature: Context Toggle Button
Button Functionality:
Add a button to the interface. When clicked, the button changes color to indicate that it's active.
When active, the system (Deepseek) enters a different context: "Make this AI modern and minimalistic like ShadCN UI."
Purpose: When users paste code while this mode is active, the AI will return an enhanced version of the code, improving its UI and 
usability to follow modern, minimalistic standards (like ShadCN UI).


Objective
The point of this prompt is to create a feature-rich interface where:
Users have control over model selection and template availability.
Users can toggle a web designer mode with a single button click to enhance their code with a clean and modern design automatically.

Please refine current functionality of prompt window in our component:
Currently, the chat prompt textbox in my chatbot application only displays about one and a half lines of text, 
which feels restrictive. I want to improve this by making the textbox expandable. It should grow vertically as the user types, 
up to a reasonable limit, ensuring more lines are visible without feeling cramped. Ideally, it should expand upwards toward the 
'answer' window, similar to how modern chat applications like ChatGPT handle it. Maybe you also handle it like that, but your website
is unavailable, so I cant tell. This allows for a better user experience when composing longer prompts.




PROMPT 5

For the functionality where a user clicks a template and it appears in the textbox, and then clicks again to send it, 
add an enhancement: When the template is clicked (and inserted into the textbox), the template button should start pulsing 
or display a 'Confirm' text over it. This will indicate to the user that they need to click again to send the prompt.


PROMPT 6

Please, for the "Activate Design Mode", when activated, I want to return just enhanced UI code,
with tailwindcss, no additional text around, and keep the good styling practices as previously



PROMPT 7

Please fix the issue where a user can write a long message, but it is not properly formatted,
causing the message to expand and increase the window width. Ensure that messages have correctly
defined boundaries to maintain a consistent layout.
